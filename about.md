Born and grown in the beautiful Sardinia in Italy, I moved to Zurich to complete my studies at the ETH (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). After working on delay tolerant networks with Android devices I focused more on Web development and scalable and resilient software architectures on the cloud. Currently working as a Freelancer at Interdiscount, the market leader for electronics in Switzerland.
